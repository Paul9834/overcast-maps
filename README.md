# Overcast Network Public Cardinal Maps

Public Overcast Network map downloads for Cardinal servers.

All maps can be downloaded at https://mcresourcepile.github.io/mapstack/overcast?s=cardinal. Please check what license each map uses on our [website](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/mapstack/overcast?s=cardinal) before using them on public servers. If you wish to use a non-commercial map for commercial purposes, please get in contact with the map authors.

To include this repository in your [Cardinal server](https://github.com/twizmwazin/CardinalPGM), add the following line to your `repos:` config:

`- git:https://github.com/MCResourcePile/overcast-cardinal-maps.git`

Your repository will automatically update as more maps are added and tested with Cardinal ensuring that you only get functional maps. If you do find a map that isn't working as expected in the repository, please create an [issue on our tracker](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/overcast-cardinal-maps/issues/new).

Other maps that either don't currently work or haven't been tested with CardinalPGM can be found [here](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/overcast-maps).
