Your repository will automatically update as more maps are added and tested with Cardinal ensuring that you only get functional maps.

# Overcast Network Public Maps

Publicly downloadable maps from the Overcast Network repository.

All maps can be downloaded at https://mcresourcepile.github.io/mapstack/overcast. Please check what license each map uses on our [website](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/mapstack/overcast) before using them on public servers. If you wish to use a non-commercial map for commercial purposes, please get in contact with the map authors.

These maps have not been tested on a [CardinalPGM server](https://github.com/twizmwazin/CardinalPGM) and it is not recommended that you include this repository as the maps are most likely broken. You can find a repository of maps that have been tested and work correctly with CardinalPGM [here](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/overcast-cardinal-maps) or by using our [website](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/mapstack/overcast?s=cardinal).

You can find maps created for the Overcast Network that did not make it to the official repository [here](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/overcast-unofficial-maps) or by using our [website](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/mapstack/overcast?s=unofficial).

Please submit your maps [here](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/forms/maps).
